- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hayden-Reed
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and am a cybersecurity major at the University of Cincinnati and am slowly 
- becoming more interested in the back end launguages that databases and networks use to connect to different nodes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQl database launguage and am looking to further my knowledge into JAVA, C#, and C++ and other commonly used launguages within the 
- Information technology field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that seem interesting or for any professional work as I am not proficient enough at the moment.
- I hope to gain work experience within the industry to help further my knowledge and career outlook.
